store all fonts here that are being used and/or were provided.

each font should have the font file (.otf, .ttf, PostScript)
along with licences for each (typically when paid for)
and any third party vendor contact and login and account info

Even if you are using a Google font, these libraries are constantly 
updated. 
* keep a safe copy here just in case.
