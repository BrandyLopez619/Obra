this folder will vary as with any website but depending on the service they offer
but it is essentially the structure of the website by the names of specific pages.

Working with a client:

90% of the time the client has a gmail account and can use google drive:

0. make a folder using "Client 1\project_name_1\05. Content" stucture on google drive

1. select all the folders within the "Client 1\project_name_1\05. Content" folder

2. upload them to google drive (or drop box) 
	
* this makes it very easy for a client to provide necessary files

tips:

create a simple userguide directing clients to upload most usable and convenient files:
     When uploading files please remember:
	- avoid using PDF's
  	- do not embedd images into text files (word, pdf, indesign)
	- for written content use only .txt files
	- ensure all final image quality, no pixelation visible
	- for vector images (logos, illustrations, custom lettering)
	  please provide separate vector document (.eps, .ai, .svg)
